# #Hemp-Disease-Detection-and-Classification-using-Machine-learning-model#

Hemp is a multipurpose plant that has industrial as well as medicinal value. The plant is easy to grow, maintain and suitable under any climate. However, just like other plants, hemp diseases not only affect hemp plant growth, but also cause a significant economic lost in hemp production.In this project I have created ensemble machine learning model with transfer learning to detect and classify hemp plant diseases. For hemp disease detection and classification, I have developed ensemble model based on AlexNet for feature extraction and a Random Forest Classifier for classification.The final accuracy I got for testing data using this model is 91%.In this project, I have focused on four common hemp diseases which are leaf spots, bud rot, powdery mildew, and nutrient deficiency.So to summarize this model can classify 6 different classes 1)Hemp Leaf Spots , 2) Hemp Bud Rot, 3) Hemp Powdery Mildew, 4) Hemp Nutrient Deficiency, 5) Healthy Hemp and 6) Not-Hemp with 91% accuracy.
